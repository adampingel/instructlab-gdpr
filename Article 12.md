3. 1The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under [[Article 15]] to [[Article 22]]to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. 2That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. 3The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. 4Where the data subject makes the request by electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.

	2. refuse to act on the request.3The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.
