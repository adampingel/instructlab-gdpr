1In order to ensure the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established. 2That mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several Member States. 3It should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency mechanism. 4That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties.
