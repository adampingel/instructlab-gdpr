1Every data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed or where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject. 2The investigation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case. 3The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. 4If the case requires further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate information should be given to the data subject. 5In order to facilitate the submission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically, without excluding other means of communication.
