1To further strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal data is carried out by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format, and to transmit it to another controller. 2Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. 3That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. 4It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. 5By its very nature, that right should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. 6It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. 7The data subject’s right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible. 8Where, in a certain set of personal data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. 9Furthermore, that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. 10Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another.
